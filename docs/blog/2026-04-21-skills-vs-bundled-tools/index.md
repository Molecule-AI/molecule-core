# Skills Over Bundled Tools: Why Composable AI Beats Platform Primitives

Hermes v0.10.0 launched Tool Gateway — a set of built-in tools (web search, image generation, TTS, browser automation) available to paid Portal subscribers. If you're evaluating AI agent platforms, you might see a feature list comparison that looks like this:

- **Hermes:** Has web search, image gen, TTS, browser automation — *out of the box*
- **Molecule AI:** Doesn't seem to have these — *requires skill installation*

That reading is fair. It's also incomplete.

This piece explains what "skills" actually means on Molecule AI, why composability is structurally different from bundled tools, and how the two approaches serve fundamentally different use cases.

## What "Bundled Tools" Actually Means

Hermes Tool Gateway ships four capabilities as platform-level primitives. When you use them, you're using the same implementation every other Hermes user uses — same models, same rate limits, same behavior. You can't swap the image generator for a different one. You can't add a new tool to the bundle without a platform update.

**The appeal is real:** sign up, start using, no configuration. That's excellent for a personal productivity tool.

**The limitation is structural:** you get what's shipped. Your agent's capabilities are defined by what the platform vendor decided to include, and they don't change until the vendor ships an update.

## What "Skills" Actually Means

Skills on Molecule AI are installable capability packages — analogous to npm packages or pip modules, but for agent capabilities. A skill packages:

- **Tool definitions** — the JSON Schema interfaces the agent sees
- **Runtime code** — the actual implementation (API calls, local processing, etc.)
- **Configuration** — sensible defaults, required env vars, scoping rules
- **Versioning** — install a specific version, upgrade when ready

The browser automation skill on Molecule AI isn't a different feature from Hermes' browser tool — it uses the same underlying technology (Chrome DevTools Protocol over WebSocket). The difference is *how you install it* and *what you can do with it*:

```bash
# Install browser automation skill
molecule skills install browser-automation

# Install TTS skill (alternative: use your own provider)
molecule skills install tts --provider openai

# Install a community skill
molecule skills install arxiv-research --from community
```

After installation, your agent sees the tools the same way it sees any other tool — they're first-class in the agent's tool context. But unlike Hermes' bundled approach, you can:

- Swap the TTS provider (OpenAI → ElevenLabs → self-hosted)
- Version-pin to a known-good skill release
- Inspect the skill code (it's just Python)
- Contribute a new or improved version back to the community
- Run the same skill locally or on any cloud VM

## The Composability Difference

Bundled tools are a feature set. Skills are a *package manager*. The difference matters as your agent stack grows.

**With bundled tools:** you use what ships. If the image generator doesn't support a format you need, you file a feature request.

**With skills:** you combine what's available. Need a specialized tool that doesn't exist? Write a skill and install it. Someone else already built it? Install it with one command.

The skills ecosystem on Molecule AI already covers the same ground as Hermes Tool Gateway — browser automation, TTS, image generation, web search — plus dozens of additional capabilities contributed by the community. You start from zero by default, which has higher first-run friction. But the ceiling is open.

## The Production Trust Angle

For **individual developers**, bundled tools win on first-impression convenience. For **production teams**, the calculus is different.

When you deploy an agent in production, you need to answer:

- *Who has access to which tools?* (auth)
- *Which pipeline used which tool?* (audit)
- *Can I revoke access without a redeploy?* (operations)

Hermes Tool Gateway is designed for personal Portal accounts — there's no org-level auth, no per-user scoping, no audit trail across a team.

Molecule AI's skills run inside workspaces, which means they inherit the full access control model:

- **Org-scoped API keys** — name, revoke, and audit every integration independently
- **Workspace-level secrets** — per-agent credential management, no shared tokens
- **Audit trail** — `org:keyId` on every request, chain of custody from minting to use

If you're evaluating a platform for a team, the question isn't just "does it have tools?" — it's "can I trust those tools in a production context?" Molecule AI's answer to that question is the skills ecosystem *plus* the auth layer that surrounds it.

## The Unified Narrative

Here's how the comparison lands:

> **Hermes** is a personal AI assistant — batteries included, no auth model, no team features.
>
> **Molecule AI** is a platform your team can build on, ship to customers, and trust in production — with skills for every capability Hermes bundles, org-level auth, and audit on every call.

If you want to evaluate Molecule AI's skills coverage, start here:

→ [MCP browser automation guide](/blog/browser-automation-ai-agents-mcp) — browser tools via Chrome DevTools Protocol, same capability as Hermes' built-in browser
→ [TTS and image generation skills](/docs/guides/skill-catalog) — community-contributed, versioned, swappable
→ [Org-scoped API keys](/docs/guides/org-api-keys.md) — production auth and audit

**The tagline:** Batteries included is nice. Batteries you can trust, extend, and audit is a platform.

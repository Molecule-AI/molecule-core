# Browser Automation Meets Production Standards

Chrome DevTools MCP shipped in early 2026. For AI agents that support the MCP protocol, it means browser automation — screenshot, DOM inspection, network interception, JavaScript execution — is now a first-class, standards-based tool. No custom wrappers. No browser-driver installation. Just a tool definition your agent can call like any other.

That's a meaningful step forward. Browser automation that used to require a Selenium grid or a custom CDP client is now accessible to any agent that speaks MCP.

## The Problem With Raw CDP Access

Chrome DevTools Protocol access is, by design, all-or-nothing. CDP exposes the full capability surface of Chrome — every tab, every network request, every cookie store, every `window`. There's no concept of scoped permissions in raw CDP itself.

For prototypes, that's fine. You're building something, you want to see what's possible, you give the agent the keys and you explore.

For production — especially anything touching customer-facing workflows or authenticated sessions — "all-or-nothing" is a governance gap. You need something between no browser and full admin access:

- Which agents can open a browser?
- What can they do with it once it's open?
- Can they read cookies from a logged-in session?
- Can they run arbitrary JavaScript on a customer page?
- How do you revoke access if the agent behaves unexpectedly?
- When something goes wrong, how do you answer the question: *which agent accessed what session data, and when?*

Raw CDP doesn't answer any of those. Molecule AI does.

## Molecule AI's MCP Governance Layer

Every AI agent platform that supports MCP can give an agent access to Chrome DevTools. Molecule AI gives you the controls to answer the questions above — before you put it in front of customers.

### Plugin allowlist governance

Molecule AI's plugin system lets you control which plugins an agent can load. The `molecule-security-scan` plugin can inspect a plugin's tool definitions before it's installed and surface risky capabilities — like a browser-automation plugin that requests DOM access or cookie read permissions. Admins can approve, deny, or scope those permissions from the canvas before the agent ever boots.

### Org API keys for scoped, auditable access

When an agent uses Chrome DevTools MCP, every call is made with the agent's workspace bearer token. That token is tied to a specific workspace ID and, if your org uses org API keys, an identifiable actor in your audit trail.

If you need to revoke: delete the workspace token or the org API key. The next heartbeat or API call fails, the agent is offline within 30 seconds. No waiting for a session to expire, no cross-cutting secret rotation.

### Per-workspace audit trail

Every platform API call — including the MCP tool calls that proxy through to Chrome DevTools — is logged with the workspace ID, actor, and timestamp. If a customer asks who accessed their session data, the answer is in your audit trail. Not in a raw CDP trace. Not in a developer's local terminal history. In your platform logs, attributed to an org API key and a workspace.

## Real-World Use Cases the Governance Layer Enables

**Automated Lighthouse performance audits in CI/CD**
An agent runs Lighthouse against your staging environment as part of every pull request. No human in the loop. The agent opens Chrome, navigates the app, runs the audit, and posts the score to your PR. The org API key that triggered it is in the audit log. The Lighthouse report is attached to the PR. Revocation is a DELETE call away.

**Screenshot-based visual regression testing**
An agent navigates a customer-facing page before and after a deploy, takes screenshots, and diffs them. If the diff crosses a pixel-threshold, the agent flags it and opens a ticket. The agent runs in its own workspace, with its own scoped token. Other workspaces can't access its browser session.

**Authenticated session scraping**
An agent operates behind a login — navigates to an internal tool, authenticates with a stored session cookie, and extracts data that would otherwise require a separate scraping infrastructure. The session cookie is stored as a workspace secret in Molecule AI, not hardcoded in the agent's environment. Rotate the secret, the agent picks it up on next pull.

## Setup

The Chrome DevTools MCP server is available as a standard MCP tool definition. Connect it to your agent through Molecule AI's MCP bridge:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "chrome-devtools": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-chrome-devtools"]
    }
  }
}
```

Then install and govern it through the Molecule AI plugin system — so the tools it exposes are visible to your org's security scan before any agent can use them.

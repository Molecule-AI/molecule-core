# How Molecule AI's Audit Ledger Works: HMAC Chains and the Fix That Made It Production-Ready

Every time an agent in your Molecule AI org does something — delegates a task, calls a tool, reads a secret, or makes an external API call — that event is written to an append-only audit log. That log is chained with HMAC-SHA256 so that any tampering with past entries is detectable, provable, and logged.

This post explains how that system works and what changed in PR #1339.

## The problem with plain audit logs

A standard audit log is a list of events with timestamps. It's useful for debugging, but it has a structural weakness: nothing stops someone with database access from editing past rows. A malicious actor — or a buggy cleanup script — can remove or modify entries, and the log looks perfectly fine.

For production multi-agent systems, that matters. Your compliance team needs to know: *did that agent actually call the API it was supposed to call, or did it skip the approval step?* A plain log can't answer that with confidence.

Molecule AI's audit ledger is built to answer that question.

---

## HMAC-SHA256 chain architecture

The audit ledger is an **append-only, chain-verified log**. Each entry contains:

- The event data (who did what, when, what the result was)
- An HMAC-SHA256 of the current entry, signed with a server-side secret
- The HMAC of the *previous* entry embedded as part of the signing context

This creates a chain — like a blockchain, but not distributed. Every entry's HMAC depends on the previous entry's HMAC, which depends on the one before that, and so on back to the genesis entry.

```
Entry 0: HMAC₀ = HMAC(genesis_payload + genesis_secret)
Entry 1: HMAC₁ = HMAC(event₁ + HMAC₀ + secret)
Entry 2: HMAC₂ = HMAC(event₂ + HMAC₁ + secret)
...
```

If you change *any* past entry, its HMAC changes. That breaks the chain at the next verification step. The tampered entry is detectable.

---

## Verifying the chain

`verifyAuditChain` walks the log from the beginning, recomputing each HMAC and comparing it against the stored value. If every entry verifies, the chain is intact — no tampering.

If an entry fails to verify, the function returns `false`. Your observability stack picks this up and can alert, halt, or log the discrepancy. The audit trail isn't just a record of what happened — it's a proof that the record hasn't been altered.

This is what compliance auditors want: not a log, but a **tamper-evident log with cryptographic guarantees**.

---

## What org-scoped keys add

Org-scoped API keys are the attribution layer on top of the integrity layer.

Each org key carries a name, a hash, and a prefix. Every authenticated call carries that prefix in the audit row:

```
org-token:mole_a1b2 POST /workspaces/ws_abc123/secrets 200 3ms
```

Combined with the HMAC chain, you get two guarantees simultaneously:
1. **Integrity** — the audit log hasn't been tampered with (HMAC chain)
2. **Attribution** — you know exactly which named key (and therefore which integration) made each call (org API keys)

For teams running SOC 2 or ISO 27001, this is the difference between "here's a log" and "here's a cryptographically verifiable, attributable record of everything that happened."

## The bug PR #1339 fixed

In Go, slicing a string beyond its length causes a panic:

```go
// This panics if len(ev.HMAC) < 12
log.Printf("expected: %q  got: %q", ev.HMAC[:12], expected[:12])
```

`verifyAuditChain` was using `[:12]` to truncate HMACs for log readability — 12 characters is enough to identify a key without printing the full hash. But if an audit row had been corrupted (a database write failure, a migration bug, manual intervention), the stored HMAC could be shorter than 12 bytes. When that row was processed, the verification pass would panic and crash.

A tamper attempt wouldn't just fail verification — it would take down the verification process.

**The fix (PR #1339):** add a length check before truncation.

```go
storedPrefix := ev.HMAC
if len(storedPrefix) > 12 {
    storedPrefix = storedPrefix[:12]
}
computedPrefix := expected
if len(computedPrefix) > 12 {
    computedPrefix = computedPrefix[:12]
}
log.Printf("expected: %q  got: %q", storedPrefix, computedPrefix)
```

The logic is unchanged — if the HMAC is long enough, the same 12-char prefix is logged. If it's short or missing, a shorter prefix (or none) is logged. Either way, the chain verification still runs, and mismatches still fail correctly.

The panic is gone. The integrity guarantee holds.

## What this means for production deployments

If you're running Molecule AI in a production environment:

- **The audit log is tamper-evident by construction.** You can verify the chain integrity programmatically at any point and alert on failures.
- **Org-scoped keys give you per-integration attribution.** A compromised CI key is identifiable, revocable, and its entire call history is reconstructable.
- **PR #1339 ensures the verification pass itself is hardened.** Corrupt rows — whether from a bug, a migration, or an attack — are handled gracefully, not catastrophically.

The combination of HMAC chain + org-scoped key attribution + immediate revocation is the foundation of Molecule AI's production trust model for enterprise teams.

# API Reference

This document describes the REST API exposed by the Molecule AI workspace server (Go/Gin, default port `:8080`). Clients include the Canvas frontend, workspace agents communicating over A2A, and external tooling such as the MCP server and CLI.

**Base URL:** `http://localhost:8080` (development default)
**Rate limit:** 600 req/min (configurable via `RATE_LIMIT`)
**CORS origins:** `http://localhost:3000,http://localhost:3001` by default (configurable via `CORS_ORIGINS`)

## Authentication

Three middleware classes gate server-side routes:

- **`AdminAuth`** — strict bearer-only. Required for any route that can leak prompts/memory, create/mutate workspaces, or expose ops intel. Lazy-bootstrap fail-open when no live tokens exist globally.
- **`WorkspaceAuth`** — binds a bearer token to a specific workspace `:id`. A token for workspace A cannot be used against workspace B's sub-routes.
- **`CanvasOrBearer`** — accepts a bearer token OR a request Origin matching `CORS_ORIGINS`. Used only for cosmetic routes with zero data/security impact (currently `PUT /canvas/viewport` only). Do not extend to routes that leak data or create resources.

Full contract: `docs/runbooks/admin-auth.md`.

## Routes

| Method | Path | Handler |
|--------|------|---------|
| GET | /health | inline |
| GET | /metrics | metrics.Handler() — Prometheus text format; no auth, scrape-safe |
| POST/GET/PATCH/DELETE | /workspaces[/:id] | workspace.go — `GET /workspaces`, `POST /workspaces`, and `DELETE /workspaces/:id` require `AdminAuth`. `PATCH /workspaces/:id` enforces field-level authz: cosmetic fields (name, role, x, y, canvas) pass through; sensitive fields (tier, parent_id, runtime, workspace_dir) require a valid bearer token when any live token exists. |
| GET/PATCH | /workspaces/:id/config | workspace.go |
| GET/POST | /workspaces/:id/memory | workspace.go |

## Database

Migration files live in `platform/migrations/` (latest: `022_workspace_schedules_source`). Each migration ships as a `.up.sql`/`.down.sql` pair. The migration runner globs `*.sql`, filters out `.down.sql` files, sorts alphabetically, and executes each file on boot. All `.up.sql` files must be idempotent (`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`, `ALTER TABLE ... IF NOT EXISTS`) because the runner re-applies every migration on every boot.

### Key Tables

| Table | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `workspaces` | Core entity — status, runtime, `agent_card` JSONB, heartbeat columns, `current_task`, `awareness_namespace`, `workspace_dir` |
| `canvas_layouts` | Per-workspace x/y canvas position |
| `structure_events` | Append-only event log (workspace lifecycle, agent, approval events) |
| `activity_logs` | A2A communications, task updates, agent logs, errors. `error_detail` is populated by the scheduler so cron run history can surface failure reasons. |
| `workspace_schedules` | Cron tasks — expression, timezone, prompt, run history, `source` (`'template'` for org/import-seeded, `'runtime'` for Canvas/API-created), `last_status` (includes `'skipped'` when the scheduler concurrency-skips a busy workspace) |
| `workspace_channels` | Social channel integrations (Telegram, Slack, etc.) with JSONB config and allowlist |
| `agents` | Agent records |
| `workspace_secrets` | Per-workspace encrypted secrets |
| `global_secrets` | Platform-wide encrypted secrets |
| `workspace_auth_tokens` | Bearer tokens; auto-revoked on workspace delete |
| `agent_memories` | HMA scoped memory (LOCAL / TEAM / GLOBAL) |
| `approvals` | Human-in-the-loop approval requests |

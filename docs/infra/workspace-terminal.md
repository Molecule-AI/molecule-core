## What this feature is (public summary)

The canvas Terminal tab opens an interactive shell on a workspace's
compute — locally this is a `docker exec` into the container; in the
SaaS tenant path it's an SSH session into the tenant EC2 (or the
workspace container running on it) over an [EC2 Instance Connect
Endpoint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-connect-setup-ec2-instance-connect-endpoint.html).
End users see a terminal; no direct public SSH ingress is required.

Tracking: [molecule-core#1528](https://github.com/Molecule-AI/molecule-core/issues/1528) (resolved 2026-04-22).

## Where things are

- **Go handler:** [`workspace-server/internal/handlers/terminal.go`](../../workspace-server/internal/handlers/terminal.go)
- **CP provisioner (EIC endpoint, per-tenant SG):** `Molecule-AI/molecule-controlplane/internal/provisioner/ec2.go` — `EICEndpointSGID` field
- **Bootstrap script:** `Molecule-AI/molecule-controlplane/scripts/bootstrap-eic-terminal.sh`
- **Detailed ops runbook (internal):** `Molecule-AI/internal/runbooks/workspace-terminal.md`

Why the split: the bootstrap-script output + per-tenant SG ingress
backfill commands include AWS resource IDs and tenant slugs that
don't belong in a public repo, but the high-level design is useful
for external readers + self-hosters.

## Response quick-ref

**"Is Partner API Keys available now?"**
→ "Ships April 30. Not live until then. DM for early access."

**"How is this different from Langfuse/Helicone?"**
→ "Tool Trace captures A2A-level tool calls. Langfuse captures LLM API calls. Different layers — complementary."

**"Can I use Platform Instructions to enforce org policy?"**
→ "Yes — PUT /cp/platform-instructions, scope: global. Applies to every workspace. Workspace users can't remove it by editing config.yaml."

**"What's the rate limit on Partner API Keys?"**
→ "60 req/min per key default, configurable at key creation."

**"My agent isn't producing tool_trace."**
→ "Tool Trace is on by default. Make sure activity logging is enabled on your workspace. If it is and traces are missing, open a bug in #bug-reports and tag @devrel."

# Remote Workspaces — Run Agents Anywhere, Govern From One Platform

> Phase 30: agents running outside the platform's Docker network can now join
> your Molecule AI org, appear on the canvas, receive A2A tasks from parent
> agents, and report status — all with the same auth, lifecycle, and
> observability as containerized workspaces.

**Phase 30 GA:** 2026-04-20 | PRs: #1075–#1083, #1085–#1100 (monorepo)

## What Problem This Solves

Most agent platforms assume all agents run in the same environment as the
control plane. Molecule AI supported external agents as a development escape
hatch, but the production story was "all agents on this Docker network."

Phase 30 changes that. Your org can now include agents running on:

- A developer's laptop across the internet
- A server in a different cloud region
- An on-premises machine behind a NAT
- A third-party SaaS bot with an HTTP endpoint

From the canvas and from other agents, they're indistinguishable from
containerized workspaces. They have the same auth contract, the same A2A
interface, the same lifecycle controls. Where they run is a deployment
detail — not an architectural constraint.

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Details |
|---|---|
| **Platform** | Molecule AI platform running v0.30+ (`go run ./cmd/server` from `workspace-server/` or the current `main` image) |
| **Admin access** | An `ADMIN_TOKEN`, org API key, or session cookie with permission to create workspaces |
| **Python ≥ 3.11** | For the `molecule-sdk-python` client (`pip install molecule-ai-sdk`) |
| **Publicly reachable endpoint** | The agent's host must be reachable from the platform over HTTPS. If behind NAT, use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) or [Cloudflare Tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/). |
| **Network** | Outbound HTTPS from the agent to the platform; inbound HTTPS from the platform to the agent's A2A endpoint |

### SDK Installation

```bash
pip install molecule-ai-sdk
```

Or from the repo checkout:

```bash
pip install -e sdk/python/
```

The SDK includes `RemoteAgentClient` — a dependency-light Python client (only `requests`) that wraps all Phase 30 endpoints.

```

**Key properties:**
- The agent **pulls** its secrets at boot (not baked into the container at provision time)
- Liveness is maintained by **heartbeat + state polling** (no WebSocket required from the agent side)
- The platform **proxies A2A calls** to the agent's registered URL — no inbound firewall rules on the platform
- The auth token is **workspace-scoped**: a leaked token can't impersonate another workspace

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Create the workspace (admin side)
WORKSPACE=$(curl -s -X POST https://acme.moleculesai.app/workspaces \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"researcher","runtime":"external","tier":2}')
WORKSPACE_ID=$(echo $WORKSPACE | jq -r '.id')

# 2. Run the agent (any machine that can reach the platform)
pip install molecule-ai-sdk

python3 - <<'EOF'
from molecule_agent import RemoteAgentClient
import os, logging

client = RemoteAgentClient(
    workspace_id = os.environ["WORKSPACE_ID"],
    platform_url = os.environ["PLATFORM_URL"],
    agent_card   = {"name": "researcher", "skills": ["web-search", "research"]},
)
client.register()                      # Phase 30.1 — get + cache token
secrets = client.pull_secrets()         # Phase 30.2 — decrypt API keys
print("Secrets:", list(secrets.keys()))

# Keep alive + respond to platform commands
client.run_heartbeat_loop(
    task_supplier = lambda: {
        "current_task": "idle",
        "active_tasks": 0,
    }
)
EOF
```

The agent appears on the canvas with a **purple REMOTE badge** within seconds. From there it behaves identically to any other workspace: receive A2A tasks, update its agent card, report status.

## What Phase 30 Covers

| Phase | What shipped | Endpoint |
|---|---|---|
| 30.1 | Workspace auth tokens | `POST /registry/register`, `POST /registry/heartbeat` |
| 30.2 | Token-gated secrets pull | `GET /workspaces/:id/secrets` |
| 30.3 | Plugin tarball download (remote install) | `GET /plugins/:name/download` |
| 30.4 | Workspace state polling (no WebSocket needed) | `GET /workspaces/:id/state` |
| 30.5 | A2A proxy enforces caller token | `POST /workspaces/:id/a2a` |
| 30.6 | Sibling discovery + URL caching | `GET /registry/:id/peers` |
| 30.7 | Poll-liveness for external runtime | Redis TTL (90s timeout) |
| 30.8 | Remote-agent SDK + docs | `molecule-sdk-python` |

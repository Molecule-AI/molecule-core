# build-all.sh — Rebuild base image and optionally adapter images.
#
# NOTE: Adapters have been extracted to standalone template repos:
#   https://github.com/Molecule-AI/molecule-ai-workspace-template-<runtime>
#
# This script now only builds the base image from workspace/Dockerfile.
# Each adapter repo has its own Dockerfile that installs molecule-ai-workspace-runtime
# from PyPI and the adapter-specific deps.
#
# Usage:
#   bash workspace/build-all.sh          # Build base image only
#
# Standalone adapter repos still reference the legacy base image for local dev
# (e.g. FROM workspace-template:base). To build those locally, clone the adapter
# repo and run `docker build -t workspace-template:<runtime> .` from its root.

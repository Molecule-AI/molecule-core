"""Per-process runtime-wedge state.

Adapter executors that hit a non-recoverable wedge (e.g. claude-agent-sdk's
`Control request timeout: initialize` corrupting the client process's
internal state) call mark_wedged(reason). The heartbeat task reads
is_wedged() / wedge_reason() and forwards them in the heartbeat payload's
runtime_state field — the platform then flips workspace status to
`degraded` so the canvas surfaces a Restart hint instead of leaving the
user staring at a green dot while every chat hangs.

Module scope (not instance scope) is deliberate: the wedge is a property
of the Python process, not any particular executor. With one executor
per workspace process today this is the simplest lock-free
read+write fit. A future per-org multi-executor design could move this
to a shared registry.

This module lives in molecule-runtime (NOT in any adapter / template
repo) because:

  1. workspace/heartbeat.py reads it on every heartbeat — cross-cutting
     concern, runtime owns it.
  2. Multiple adapter executors can mark themselves wedged with their
     own reason; the runtime aggregates one flag for the platform.
  3. Decoupling from claude_sdk_executor is the prerequisite for the
     universal-runtime refactor (molecule-core task #87) — without
     this extraction, claude_sdk_executor.py couldn't move to its
     template repo because heartbeat would lose access to the wedge
     state.

Public API: mark_wedged(reason), clear_wedge(), is_wedged(),
wedge_reason(). The reset_for_test() helper is for unit tests only.

How to use from a NEW adapter (template repo)
---------------------------------------------

Hermes, Codex, LangGraph, or any future adapter that wants the same
"flip-to-degraded-on-fatal-wedge" UX should call mark_wedged + clear_wedge
from its executor. The runtime imports + heartbeat plumbing are already
in place — adapters do not change anything in molecule-runtime.

Minimum integration (~6 LOC inside the executor):

    # Import path:
    #   - In a TEMPLATE repo (the common case for new adapters), the
    #     runtime is installed via PyPI as `molecule-ai-workspace-runtime`,
    #     so the import is `from molecule_runtime.runtime_wedge import …`.
    #   - In molecule-core itself (when editing this repo's own
    #     workspace/ tree), the module is at the top level — import as
    #     `from runtime_wedge import …`.
    from molecule_runtime.runtime_wedge import mark_wedged, clear_wedge

    async def execute(self, ctx, queue):
        try:
            result = await self._run_query(ctx)
        except SomeFatalSdkError as e:
            # Pick a short, operator-actionable reason. This becomes the
            # banner text on the canvas's degraded card — keep it under
            # ~80 chars and name the recovery action when possible.
            mark_wedged(f"hermes init timeout — restart workspace ({e})")
            raise
        clear_wedge()  # observed-success → next heartbeat reports healthy
        return result

What you get for free:
  - Heartbeat payload sets runtime_state="wedged" + sample_error=<reason>
    on the next 30s tick.
  - registry.go's evaluateStatus flips the workspace to `degraded` and
    broadcasts WORKSPACE_DEGRADED so the canvas card turns yellow with
    your reason as the subtitle.
  - clear_wedge() on the next successful turn flips the workspace back
    to `online` automatically — no manual operator action.

What NOT to do:
  - Don't store wedge state in your adapter module. The platform-side
    consumer (heartbeat) imports from runtime_wedge by name; an adapter-
    local copy won't be observed.
  - Don't call mark_wedged for transient errors (rate limits, single
    failed network call). The whole point is "the SDK process is in a
    state that can only be cleared by restart" — false positives
    train operators to ignore the degraded banner.
  - Don't write your own clear logic. clear_wedge() is the only path
    the heartbeat watches; a custom flag won't propagate.

When wedge is the WRONG primitive: if the failure is per-request (the
SDK works for some inputs but not others), surface as a normal A2A
error response, not a wedge. Wedge means "every subsequent request in
this process will fail until restart."

Compatibility shim (will be removed once #87 Phase 2 lands)
-----------------------------------------------------------

claude_sdk_executor.py re-exports the four functions under the historical
names (is_wedged, wedge_reason, _mark_sdk_wedged, _clear_sdk_wedge_on_success)
for one release cycle. New adapter code should import from runtime_wedge
directly; the shim only exists so existing third-party adapters that
copied our claude_sdk_executor wedge convention have time to migrate.

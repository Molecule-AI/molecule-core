"""Workspace auth-token store (Phase 30.1).

Single source of truth for this workspace's authentication token. The
token is issued by the platform on the first successful
``POST /registry/register`` call and travels with every subsequent
heartbeat / update-card / (later) secrets-pull / A2A request.

The token is persisted to ``<configs>/.auth_token`` so it survives
restarts — we only expect to receive it once from the platform, since
``/registry/register`` no-ops token issuance for workspaces that already
have one on file.

Storage:
    ${CONFIGS_DIR}/.auth_token        # 0600, one line, no trailing newline

Callers interact with three functions:
    :func:`get_token`   — returns the cached token or None
    :func:`save_token`  — persists a freshly-issued token
    :func:`auth_headers`— builds the Authorization header dict for httpx

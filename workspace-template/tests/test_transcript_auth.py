"""Tests for the #328 fix — /transcript endpoint must fail-CLOSED when
the workspace auth token is not yet on disk.

Prior behaviour (regressed in #287): `if expected:` skipped the auth
check when `get_token()` returned None, so any container on
`molecule-monorepo-net` could read the full session log during the
bootstrap window. The fix lifts the guard into transcript_auth.py for
testability.

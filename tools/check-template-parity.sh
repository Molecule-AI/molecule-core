#!/usr/bin/env bash
# check-template-parity.sh — enforce parity between a workspace template's
# install.sh (bare-host / EC2 path) and start.sh (Docker path). Both scripts
# must forward the same set of provider API keys to the agent's .env so that
# a workspace built on one backend behaves identically to a workspace built
# on the other.
#
# Drift this catches:
#   - Someone adds HERMES_API_KEY to start.sh but forgets install.sh.
#     EC2 workspaces using Nous fail silently; Docker works.
#   - Someone adds a HERMES_CUSTOM_BASE_URL branch to install.sh only.
#     Docker can't use a custom OpenAI-compat endpoint; EC2 can.
#
# Invocation (from template-hermes repo's CI):
#
#     bash /path/to/molecule-monorepo/tools/check-template-parity.sh \
#          install.sh start.sh
#
# Or inline via curl:
#
#     bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Molecule-AI/molecule-core/main/tools/check-template-parity.sh) \
#          install.sh start.sh
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — parity ok (or both files declare the same set of ${VAR:+VAR=...} exports)
#   1 — drift detected (emits a diff to stderr)
#   2 — usage / missing files
#
# What "parity" means here: the SET of environment-variable forwarders
# (lines of the form `${VAR:+VAR=${VAR}}`) in each file must be equal.
# The ordering, surrounding comments, and non-forwarder lines are free to
# differ — that's where the two paths legitimately diverge (bare-host vs
# Docker-entrypoint structure).

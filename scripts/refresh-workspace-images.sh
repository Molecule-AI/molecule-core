#!/usr/bin/env bash
# refresh-workspace-images.sh — pull the latest workspace template images
# from GHCR and recreate any running ws-* containers against the new digest.
#
# This is the local-dev / single-host equivalent of step 5 of the runtime CD
# chain (see docs/workspace-runtime-package.md). On a SaaS deployment the
# host's deploy pipeline does the pull on every release; this script is
# what to run on a local docker-compose host after a runtime release lands.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/refresh-workspace-images.sh                     # pull all 8 + recreate running ws-*
#   bash scripts/refresh-workspace-images.sh --runtime claude-code  # pull just one template
#   bash scripts/refresh-workspace-images.sh --no-recreate          # pull only, leave containers
#
# Behavior:
#   - Always pulls fresh; docker is a no-op if local matches remote, so
#     repeated runs are cheap.
#   - Recreate is "kill + remove + let the next canvas interaction re-
#     provision" — simpler than `docker stop / docker run` because the
#     platform owns the run flags. Workspaces re-register on next probe.
#   - If a container is mid-conversation, the kill cancels in-flight work.
#     Run during a quiet window OR add --no-recreate and recreate manually
#     via canvas Restart buttons.
